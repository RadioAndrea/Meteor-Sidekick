# Meteor-Sidekick
Slide out keyboard for modern smartphones

Uses Nice!Nano as a microcontroller and the first implementation is sized to a Pixel 7 Pro

Current implementation is with the Kailh Scissor switches as they are very thin and available unlike the ultramecs

If you know of a way to get thinner mechanical switches, please let me know!

# Project Status
## November 2022
Boards that were created were milled with the wrong size of drill bit due to board fab error.
Fabricator remade boards to rectify this.

## January 2023
New boards arrived and components are still being collected.

## Jul 2023
Solder paste stencil arrived and reflow oven was obtained.
Soldering of transistors will happen by paste and reflow, while switches will be done entirely by hand.
