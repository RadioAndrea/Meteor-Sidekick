# Meteor-Sidekick
Slide out keyboard for modern smartphones

Uses Nice!Nano as a microcontroller and the first implementation is sized to a Pixel 7 Pro

Current implementation is with the Kailh Scissor switches as they are very thin and available unlike the ultramecs

If you know of a way to get thinner mechanical switches, please let me know!

Board currently in-production for first round of testing
