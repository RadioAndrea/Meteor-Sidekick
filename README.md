# Meteor-Sidekick
Slide out keyboard for modern smartphones

Uses Nice!Nano as a microcontroller and the first implementation is sized to a Pixel 7 Pro

Current implementation is with the Kailh Scissor switches as they are very thin and available unlike the ultramecs 6c switches.

If you know of a way to get thinner mechanical switches, like the Ultramecs, at a reasonable price (not $150 a board), please raise an issue in this repo.

Board has been produced and now soldered thanks to my steady handed assistant.
